# Empathy Ledger: Challenges & Solutions

## Major Challenges Faced

### 1. Trust Building Timeline
**Challenge**: Building relationships took 2-3x longer than planned
**Impact**: Delayed story collection start
**Solution**: Extended timeline, focused on quality over quantity
**Learning**: Trust cannot be rushed with vulnerable populations

### 2. Technical Complexity
**Challenge**: Blockchain and advanced features proved too complex
**Impact**: Shifted to simpler MVP approach
**Solution**: Airtable + Softr instead of custom platform
**Learning**: Start simple, add complexity later

### 3. Volunteer Capacity
**Challenge**: Volunteers needed more support than expected
**Impact**: Additional training time required
**Solution**: Created detailed guides and buddy system
**Learning**: Emotional support as important as technical training

### 4. Consent Complexity
**Challenge**: Multi-level consent harder to explain than anticipated
**Impact**: Longer intake conversations
**Solution**: Visual consent cards and simplified language
**Learning**: Plain language and visuals essential

### 5. Compensation Model
**Challenge**: Payment logistics complex without infrastructure
**Impact**: Deferred compensation implementation
**Solution**: Documented model for future activation
**Learning**: Need organizational buy-in first

## Technical Hurdles

### Data Privacy
- **Issue**: Airtable's limited privacy controls
- **Workaround**: Multiple bases and filtered views
- **Future**: Move to PostgreSQL with row-level security

### Media Management
- **Issue**: Large files overwhelming system
- **Workaround**: Dropbox integration for storage
- **Future**: CDN with automated compression

### Offline Capability
- **Issue**: Poor connectivity at some shifts
- **Workaround**: PWA with sync capability
- **Future**: Native app with robust offline mode

## Process Improvements

### What Worked Well
1. Dignity-centered approach resonated strongly
2. Visual consent process
3. Volunteer enthusiasm high
4. Story quality exceeded expectations
5. Cross-location learning

### What Needed Adaptation
1. Simplified technical requirements
2. More emotional support for volunteers
3. Flexible consent options
4. Better field documentation
5. Clearer role definitions

## Resource Constraints

### Time
- Foundation phase: 2 months → 3 months
- Story processing: 1 hour → 2-3 hours each
- Platform development: Reduced scope

### Budget
- No dedicated PM resource
- Limited technical support
- Volunteer-driven model
- Deferred compensation

### Human Resources
- Single project lead
- Volunteer collectors
- No dedicated developer
- Limited admin support
