# Privacy Audit Report - Empathy Ledger Showcase

## Date: June 22, 2025
## Status: In Progress

## Overview
This audit examines the privacy measures implemented in the Empathy Ledger Showcase to ensure all storyteller data is handled according to the consent framework.

## Current Data Exposure

### 1. Public Data Points Displayed

#### Stories Page (/stories)
- ✅ Story titles
- ✅ Story excerpts (limited to 200 chars)
- ✅ Video links (where provided)
- ✅ Storyteller names (full names displayed)
- ✅ Locations (city level only)
- ✅ Creation dates
- ❓ Themes (currently showing "Unnamed Theme")

#### Storytellers Page (/storytellers)
- ✅ Full names
- ✅ Roles (Friend, Volunteer, etc.)
- ✅ Locations (city level)
- ✅ Story counts
- ✅ Summaries (where provided)
- ❓ Profile images (not currently displayed)
- ✅ Quotes (where provided)

#### Analysis Page (/analysis)
- ✅ Aggregated statistics only
- ✅ No individual identifying information
- ✅ Location data at city level
- ✅ Role distributions
- ✅ Theme distributions (but names not showing correctly)

### 2. Privacy Concerns Identified

#### HIGH PRIORITY
1. **Full Names Displayed**: All storyteller names are shown in full without any privacy controls
   - No option for initials only
   - No anonymous option
   - Names appear in multiple places (stories, storytellers page, story cards)

2. **No Consent Level Filtering**: The system doesn't currently filter based on consent levels
   - All data is treated as fully public
   - No privacy level indicators
   - No ability to hide certain stories/storytellers

#### MEDIUM PRIORITY
3. **Theme Names**: Showing as "Unnamed Theme" - data quality issue but not privacy concern

4. **Missing Privacy Controls UI**: No interface for users to filter by privacy level

#### LOW PRIORITY
5. **Profile Images**: Not currently implemented, but would need privacy consideration

### 3. Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Implement Privacy Filtering**
   - Add consent level field to all data
   - Filter data based on consent before display
   - Add privacy indicators to UI

2. **Add Name Display Options**
   - Full name (with consent)
   - Initials only
   - Anonymous
   - First name only

3. **Create Privacy Utility Functions**
   ```typescript
   // Example implementation needed
   function displayName(storyteller: Storyteller, privacyLevel: string) {
     switch(privacyLevel) {
       case 'full': return storyteller.name;
       case 'initials': return getInitials(storyteller.name);
       case 'anonymous': return 'Anonymous';
       case 'first': return getFirstName(storyteller.name);
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Add Privacy Settings to Data Processing**
   - Update data-processing-v3.js to include consent levels
   - Add privacy flags to all exported data

### 4. Data Flow Analysis

#### Current Flow
1. Airtable → Raw data fetch (all fields)
2. Data processing (no privacy filtering)
3. Static JSON files (full data exposed)
4. Frontend display (no privacy controls)

#### Required Flow
1. Airtable → Raw data fetch (with consent fields)
2. Data processing (apply privacy filters)
3. Static JSON files (pre-filtered data)
4. Frontend display (respect privacy settings)

### 5. Security Measures

#### Currently Implemented
- ✅ No database connections (static site)
- ✅ No user authentication (public showcase)
- ✅ No form submissions
- ✅ No cookies or tracking

#### Needed
- ⚠️ Environment variable protection for API keys
- ⚠️ Rate limiting for API endpoints (if added)

## Conclusion

The current implementation displays all data publicly without privacy controls. While this may be acceptable for a showcase with pre-approved content, a production system would require:

1. Consent level management
2. Name display options
3. Story visibility controls
4. Privacy indicators in UI
5. Data filtering at processing stage

## Next Steps

1. Confirm with stakeholders if all displayed data has full consent
2. Implement basic privacy filtering in data processing
3. Add privacy level indicators to UI
4. Create documentation for privacy controls
5. Test all privacy scenarios
