## Core Principles

### Consent and Agency
- **Explicit Permission**: Always obtain written consent before collecting stories
- **Withdrawal Rights**: Allow storytellers to retract or modify stories at any time
- **Ownership Clarity**: Clearly define who owns the story and how it will be used
- **Compensation**: Be transparent about any compensation or benefits

### Story Collection Methods

| Method | Best For | Considerations |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| Structured Interviews | Detailed narratives | Requires scheduling, may feel formal |
| Conversational Approach | Natural storytelling | Needs skilled facilitator |
| Written Submissions | Reflective stories | Self-selected detail level |
| Audio/Video Recording | Authentic voice | Technical requirements, storage needs |

## Interview Techniques

### Preparation
1. **Research Context**: Understand the storyteller's background
2. **Prepare Questions**: Create open-ended prompts
3. **Set Environment**: Choose comfortable, private spaces
4. **Test Equipment**: Ensure recording devices work properly

### During Collection

### Question Framework

**Opening Questions**
- "Could you tell me about..."
- "What was it like when..."
- "Help me understand..."

**Deepening Questions**
- "What did that mean to you?"
- "How did that change things?"

**Closing Questions**

- "How would you like this story to be used?"
