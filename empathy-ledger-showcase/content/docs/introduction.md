:::info[🌟 Welcome to the Empathy Ledger]
A platform that transforms personal stories into powerful catalysts for social change, built on dignity, consent, and authentic human connection.
:::

## What is the Empathy Ledger?

The Empathy Ledger is a storytelling platform that ethically collects, manages, and shares the lived experiences of people experiencing homelessness and hardship. By treating stories as valuable assets that belong to their tellers, we create a new opportunity for organisational empathy and social impact.

Built in partnership with Orange Sky, who provide free laundry and shower services across Australia, the Empathy Ledger ensures that every story is shared with explicit consent, proper attribution, and genuine respect for the storyteller's agency.
