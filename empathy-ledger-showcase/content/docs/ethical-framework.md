Our ethical framework is built on respect, consent, and dignity. Every interaction is guided by these principles to ensure we honor the stories shared with us.

## Core Ethical Principles

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">

### 🛡️ Informed Consent
Storytellers understand exactly how their stories will be used and have complete control over sharing permissions.

### ❤️ Ongoing Agency
Consent can be modified or withdrawn at any time, with immediate effect across all systems.

### 👥 Transparency
Clear communication about data handling, storage, and usage at every step.

### 📚 Benefit Sharing
Stories create value for the community, not just the organization collecting them.
