# Storytelling Best Practices

This guide provides practical techniques for collecting, preserving, and sharing stories ethically and effectively.

## Core Principles

### 1. Dignity First
- Treat every story as a precious gift
- Respect the storyteller's autonomy
- Preserve their dignity in every interaction
- Never exploit vulnerability for impact

### 2. Consent is Ongoing
- Consent isn't a one-time checkbox
- Check in regularly about comfort levels
- Make it easy to modify or withdraw consent
- Document all consent conversations

### 3. Safety Always
- Physical and emotional safety paramount
- Create comfortable environments
- Have support resources ready
- Know when to pause or stop

## Before Collection

### Prepare Yourself
**Mentally:**
- Clear your mind of distractions
- Set aside your own agenda
- Prepare to listen deeply
- Review trauma-informed practices

**Practically:**
- Test all equipment beforehand
- Have backup recording methods
- Bring consent forms and pens
- Ensure privacy in location

### Prepare the Environment
**Physical Space:**
- Choose a quiet, private location

- Minimize interruptions
- Consider lighting and temperature

**Emotional Space:**
- Start with casual conversation
- Build rapport naturally

- Set expectations together

## During Collection

### Starting the Conversation

**Opening Approaches:**
- "Thank you for taking time to share with me today."
- "There's no right or wrong way to tell your story."

- "You can skip anything you don't want to discuss."

**Avoid:**

- Interrupting natural flow

### Active Listening Techniques

**Show You're Present:**

- "How did that make you feel?"
- "What happened next?"

**Handle Emotions:**
- Normalize emotional responses
- Offer tissues and water
- Suggest breaks when needed
- Sit with silence comfortably

### Question Frameworks

**Open-Ended Starters:**
1. "What brought you here today?"
2. "Can you describe a typical day?"
3. "What's been on your mind lately?"
4. "What would you like people to understand?"

**Deepening Questions:**
1. "What was the turning point?"
2. "Who helped you during that time?"
3. "What kept you going?"
4. "What did you learn about yourself?"

**Strength-Based Questions:**
1. "What are you most proud of?"
2. "How did you find the courage?"
3. "What skills did you discover?"
4. "What would you tell someone in a similar situation?"
