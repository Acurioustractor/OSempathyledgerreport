Our three-tier consent model ensures storytellers have complete control over how their stories are shared.

## Three-Tier Consent Model

- **Level 1: Internal Use Only**
  Stories used for internal reflection, training, and service improvement. No external sharing.

- **Level 2: Anonymous Sharing**
  Stories can be shared externally with all identifying information removed. Focus on themes and insights.

- **Level 3: Full Attribution**
  Stories shared with full attribution as chosen by the storyteller. Celebrates individual experiences.
