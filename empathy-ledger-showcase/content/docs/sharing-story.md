## Your Rights

### You Control Everything

- **Choose what to share** - Only share what feels comfortable
- **Set boundaries** - Decide which parts of your story can be used
- **Change your mind** - Update or remove consent at any time
- **Stay anonymous** - Share without revealing your identity
- **Get copies** - Access your stories whenever you want

### Consent Levels

| Level | What It Means | Example Use |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| **Personal** | Only you and Orange Sky can see it | Internal learning and improvement |
| **Anonymous** | Shared without your name or details | Reports and general awareness |
| **Public** | Shared with your name (if you choose) | Website stories and campaigns |

## The Process

### 1. Initial Conversation
A volunteer will explain how stories are used and answer any questions you have.

### 2. Share Your Story
Choose how you want to share - talking, writing, or through photos.

### 3. Review Consent
Go through the consent form together to choose how your story can be used.

### 4. Stay Connected
You'll receive updates on how your story is making a difference.

## What Happens to Your Story

### Safe Storage
Your story is securely stored with restricted access. Only authorized team members can view it based on your consent level.

### Thoughtful Use
Stories are used to:
- Help Orange Sky improve services
- Show funders and supporters the real impact
- Inspire volunteers and staff
- Advocate for policy changes
- Build community understanding

### Regular Check-ins
We'll check with you periodically to ensure you're still comfortable with how your story is being used.

## Support Available

If sharing your story brings up difficult feelings:
- Let the volunteer know - they're trained to support you
- Take breaks whenever needed
- Share only what feels right
- Access mental health support through Orange Sky's partners

## Your Story Matters

Every story shared helps build understanding and drives positive change. Whether you share a small moment or a life journey, your experience is valuable and deserves to be heard.
