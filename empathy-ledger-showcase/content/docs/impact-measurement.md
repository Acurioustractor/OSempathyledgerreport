# Impact Measurement Framework

Measure the real-world outcomes of storytelling initiatives beyond metrics to demonstrate meaningful change.

## Impact Dimensions

### Individual Impact

**Storyteller Benefits:**

|---------|------------|-------------|
| Empowerment | Self-efficacy scores | Pre/post surveys |
| Connection | Social network growth | Relationship mapping |
| Healing | Wellbeing improvements | Validated scales |
| Agency | Decision-making control | Qualitative interviews |
| Recognition | Feeling heard/valued | Feedback forms |

**Audience Impact:**
| Outcome | Indicators | Measurement |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Awareness | Knowledge increase | Quiz/surveys |
| Empathy | Attitude shifts | Implicit bias tests |
| Behavior | Action taken | Tracking commitments |
| Advocacy | Speaking up | Social monitoring |

### Organizational Impact

**Service Delivery:**
- Program improvements implemented
- Policy changes adopted
- Resource allocation shifts
- Staff training updates
- Cultural changes observed

**Stakeholder Engagement:**
- Volunteer recruitment lift
- Donor retention rates
- Partner collaboration depth
- Media coverage quality
- Community trust scores

### Societal Impact

**Systems Change:**
- Policy influence documented
- Public discourse shifts
- Stigma reduction evidence
- Resource mobilization
- Coalition building

## Measurement Methods

### Quantitative Approaches

**Surveys & Scales:**
```
Pre-Story Baseline:
□ Current awareness level (1-10)
□ Empathy scale score
□ Likelihood to act (1-5)
□ Knowledge assessment

Post-Story (Immediate):
□ Same measures
□ Story impact rating
□ Intended actions
□ Sharing likelihood

Follow-up (3 months):
□ Actions taken
□ Sustained change
□ Story recall
□ Ongoing impact
```

**Statistical Analysis:**
- T-tests for pre/post changes
- Regression for predictors
- Factor analysis for themes
- Time series for trends
- Network analysis for spread

### Qualitative Methods

**In-Depth Interviews:**
```
Interview Guide:
1. Tell me about sharing your story
2. What changed for you?
3. How did others respond?
4. What surprised you?
5. What would you tell others?
```

**Focus Groups:**
- Storytellers together
- Audience segments
- Volunteer perspectives
- Partner insights
- Community leaders

**Ethnographic Observation:**
- Service delivery changes
- Team interactions
- Community responses
- Cultural shifts
- Behavioral patterns

### Mixed Methods

**Convergent Design:**
```
Quantitative Data ─┐
                   ├→ Integration → Insights
Qualitative Data ──┘
```

**Sequential Exploration:**
1. Qualitative exploration
2. Develop measures
3. Quantitative testing
4. Qualitative depth
5. Integrated findings

## Logic Model

### Theory of Change

```
Inputs → Activities → Outputs → Outcomes → Impact

Stories → Collection → Published → Awareness → Social Change
People → Processing → Shared → Engagement → Policy Shift  
Resources → Distribution → Viewed → Action → Culture Change
```

### Outcome Mapping

**Short-term (0-3 months):**
- Stories collected
- Content published
- Initial engagement
- Awareness raised
- Connections made

**Medium-term (3-12 months):**
- Behavior changes
- Relationships built
- Skills developed
- Resources accessed
- Advocacy begun

**Long-term (1+ years):**
- Systems changed
- Lives transformed
- Communities strengthened
- Stigma reduced
- Justice advanced

## Data Collection Tools

### Digital Tracking

**Website Analytics:**
```javascript
// Impact tracking pixel
function trackImpact(action, category, value) {
  gtag('event', 'impact_action', {
    'action_type': action,
    'impact_category': category,
    'impact_value': value,
    'story_context': getStoryContext()
  });
}
```

**Conversion Tracking:**
- Volunteer signups
- Donation conversions
- Advocacy actions
- Resource downloads
- Event registrations

### Survey Platforms

**Tool Selection:**
| Platform | Best For | Cost |
|----------|----------|------|
| Typeform | Engaging UX | $35/mo |
| SurveyMonkey | Analysis tools | $25/mo |
| Google Forms | Simple/free | Free |
| Qualtrics | Academic research | $$$ |
| Alchemer | Advanced logic | $55/mo |

### Offline Methods

**Paper Forms:**
- Service point collection
- Event feedback
- Mail-in responses
- Accessibility option

**Phone Interviews:**
- Follow-up calls
- Deep conversations
- Accessibility needs
- Relationship building

## Analysis Framework

### Impact Attribution

**Contribution Analysis:**
1. Define expected outcomes
2. Identify other influences
3. Track story exposure
4. Measure changes
5. Assess contribution
6. Document evidence

**Control Groups:**
- Matched communities
- Waitlist design
- Stepped introduction
- Natural experiments
- Regression discontinuity

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Impact ROI Calculation:**
```
Social ROI = (Social Value Created / Investment) × 100

Where Social Value includes:
- Direct benefits (services accessed)
- Indirect benefits (community cohesion)
- Prevented costs (crisis intervention)
- Multiplier effects (inspired action)
```

**Value Assignment:**
| Outcome | Proxy Value | Source |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Volunteer hour | $29.95 | Independent Sector |
| Prevented ER visit | $2,200 | Healthcare costs |
| Job obtained | $25,000 | Annual income |
| Housing secured | $18,000 | Annual savings |
