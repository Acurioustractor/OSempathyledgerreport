:::info[üõ°Ô∏è Consent is Everything]
Our three-tier consent model ensures storytellers have complete control over how their stories are shared. This guide explains the process and provides all necessary forms.
:::

## Our Consent Philosophy

At the heart of the Empathy Ledger is a deep respect for individual agency and dignity. We believe that stories belong to their tellers, and consent must be informed, ongoing, and revocable.

Our consent process goes beyond legal compliance - it's about building trust, ensuring understanding, and empowering storytellers to share on their own terms.

## Three Consent Levels

### üîí Level 1: Internal Use Only
Stories are used solely for internal reflection, training, and service improvement within Orange Sky. No external sharing, complete privacy maintained. Perfect for those who want to contribute to organizational learning without public exposure.

### üë§ Level 2: Anonymous Sharing
Stories can be shared externally with all identifying information removed. Names, locations, and specific details are anonymized. Focuses on themes, insights, and collective experiences while protecting individual identity.

### üèÜ Level 3: Full Attribution
Stories are shared with full attribution as chosen by the storyteller. This celebrates individual experiences and allows storytellers to own their narrative publicly. Includes options for using real name, chosen name, or initials.

## Visual Consent Guide

For storytellers who prefer visual communication, we've developed a consent form that uses icons and simple graphics to explain each consent level. This is particularly helpful for:

‚Ä¢ People with literacy challenges
‚Ä¢ Non-native English speakers
‚Ä¢ Those who process information better visually
‚Ä¢ Quick consent situations during busy shifts

:::success[‚ôªÔ∏è Consent is Always Revocable]
Storytellers can change their consent level at any time. This includes withdrawing consent entirely, upgrading to allow more sharing, or downgrading for more privacy.

## Special Considerations

Some situations require extra care in the consent process:

‚Ä¢ **Vulnerable individuals**: Take extra time to ensure understanding
‚Ä¢ **Group stories**: Get individual consent from each person
‚Ä¢ **Minors**: Require guardian consent in addition to minor's assent
‚Ä¢ **Mental health concerns**: Consider capacity and seek support if needed
‚Ä¢ **Cultural sensitivity**: Respect cultural approaches to storytelling and sharing
