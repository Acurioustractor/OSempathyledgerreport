    "storyTranscript": "\\# Robyn Watts\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nRobin Watts. You want to know my life story? Okay. Got two girls. I started out life as a teacher, working life as a teacher.\n\nDidn't like that and got a job in local government, so I ended up the last job I had there for 20 years. And then after I retired, I discovered orange sky and my husband got sick. And he subsequently died. And Orange Sky, as I've told Nic, saved me. It made me get out of bed every day, try and push through the grief, and it's just been the best thing I've ever done, apart from having a lovely family.\n\nOh, I love it. I just absolutely love it. I honestly believe. [00:01:00] That we give a lot to friends, but they give just as much back. I go home on top of the world some days. Yeah. And I look forward to the days that I'm on shift. I love it. Really love it.\n\nIt was compounded, my husband had myeloma and the life expectancy of myeloma now is seven years, and he died after about. Three and a half. So he didn't last very long. But grief for my husband dying was a second wave of grief because six weeks before he died, our 42-year-old son-in-law just died suddenly in Sydney, leaving a 4-year-old and a 6-year-old.\n\nAnd my daughter. And totally unexpected, just completely out of left field. And he was the most wonderful human being. He was [00:02:00] American. And then later on, Ron died. And that was, I think I no, I was in denial of how sick he was. Every time we went to the hematologist, I would. Feel, oh, it wasn't that bad.\n\nIt could have been worse, but something happened to his spleen and he just said one night, I feel like I've got a pain in my chest. So I thought it might have been a heart. His heart went into hospital, didn't come out. And ended up in ICU for a week, which was horrible. Horrible. And then went into palliative care and died the next day.\n\nSo it was, but he had also been an orange sky volunteer, so I felt like I was carrying on the family tradition too by continuing to do that. But it truly did help me get out of bed. I had to, I had no choice. People depending on you, and without that, I [00:03:00] probably could have stayed. But everybody I know has said to me how well I've coped.\n\nAnd I think I've coped reasonably well. But I, I miss him. Of course .\n\nI do on my shift on Thursday, we've got, that's the longest shift we've had.\n\nIt's the oldest shift and we, the team, I've got the two boys I volunteer with, we've been together for years, probably five years. Or Russ has probably been there nearly seven years. And yes, they were supportive. I was very touched that the team leaders all went to Ron's funeral. Very unexpected. And they've helped me a lot.\n\nBut the interesting thing was that the friends. Where my shift on Thursday is the friends knew him too. That was nice, there was a consistency there. But I just I just love it. Absolutely love it. Are there particular things about it that you think are [00:04:00] more profound than others or because I think there's some parts of the, so just simple, but some parts thought out. I think it's, yes, the laundry's important obviously for. People's dignity and they have a right to that. But I think making them feel seen and heard, for me personally, that's really important and genuinely, calling them by name and remembering to ask them something.\n\nOne of my favorite quotes is from Maya Angelou says, people will forget what you said, forget what you did. But they will never forget the way you made them feel. And I really believe that. I think that is true for me, but I try to make that true for them too. So I'll, we'll talk about something that's meaningful to them.\n\nI think one of the trickier things is learning to respect and know the [00:05:00] boundaries because some people don't wanna share that much. And we've got a friend who we would, we are very frustrated. We really wanna be able to help him, but he feels that he has enough and he doesn't want to take anymore.\n\nAnd he struggles, but I've since found out he has got an advocate, which is really good. But that's a failing in the system. I think this particular friend is quite deaf and he's waited probably 18 months to get hearing aids, and I don't know how much they've shown him, but we had a volunteer on the shift one day who'd had some experience as an audiologist.\n\nSo she showed him how to put them in and he said, oh, I can hear now, but I don't, he's not doing it himself and we can't offer he's quite private. And he's quite proud, which we respect.\n\nI'm up to my nine years this year, and I wanna get my 10 years, then I'll get my unpaid long service leave.\n\nNo, I just, that is [00:06:00] a very concrete goal. I want to get to my 10 years. I've got no intention of leaving at this stage. Sometimes some of the processes that come from HQ can be a bit frustrating. I have to say though, I'd like this on record that my regional coordinator, Carolyn, is superb.\n\nShe is the best I've ever worked with. She is just amazing. Her level of support to me as service leader is immeasurable. So she's a buffer between me and the powers that be.\n\nWhat do you think or hope might happen in the next 10 years or in 10 years time? Oh, that's a good question. On a grassroots level, I hope they keep doing what they're doing. And I hope. They don't diverge too much [00:07:00] from that so that they're trying to do so many things and nothing gets done really well. I remember at the last summit I went to, they were talking about going to San Francisco, and I remember saying Then you need to get it working effectively here before you go anywhere else.\n\nI would like to see, a little bit more acknowledgement of a lot of the services. Like anybody who knew me 9, 8, 9 years ago knew that. I always said, we get forgotten down here. And it, I get that we are a long way away. I understand that. But there are times when we. We can't do the things they can do on the mainland.\n\nSo we left feeling a little bit out of things. But in terms of. The the volunteers, I think always uppermost in the minds of the staff should be [00:08:00] what the volunteers are doing because without the volunteers you have no orange sky, you have no ladder to climb, you have nothing. And I think I do what I can for, to acknowledge my team.\n\nWe've got a fabulous team of team leaders, wonderful volunteers, absolutely awesome. But sometimes it's nice to. Know that they're appreciated by others. And it's simple things like, it's our birthday in July last year. They put in the newsletter in the Spin Cycles services, birthdays.\n\nThey didn't put ours in last year. They forgot it. And that's, I know I get that we are one of however many services in Australia, but to us we are the service in Tassie. So that sort of thing upsets me a little bit.\n\nAnd I'm proud of Orange Sky. I'm very proud of Orange Sky. I'm proud to volunteer for it. I'm proud of what it [00:09:00] does. And it's, there's nothing better than when I drive to my shift on Wednesday.\n\nAnthony's there waving when I drive the van in, and, it's just such a positive experience all round. But I do think, I do think that they're going to have to be very careful that they don't lose sight of that up there. \n\n",

They're not able to access clean clothes, and when you don't have clean clothes, you don't feel very good. You get really stinky. We've got some people who need to be applying for jobs as well. So when you don't have good clothes, you feel stinky, you feel pretty rubbish about yourself.\n\nSo Orange Sky's a great service and it means that people can access fresh, clean clothes and it just, it has amazing boost to their mental health and general wellbeing. \n\nSpeaker 8: ~Something about this place, philosophy, values, safety.

It comes from a real sense for me around the local community and care for community. ~[00:00:00] When you know your neighbor, when you know their friend, you take care of them. And so I think a similar thing is translated here. We're in a smaller community, but people really care for one another.\n\nAnd when you get to see the lived experiences, you hear the stories for some of our folks, they hear similar stories from one another. And I think when you combine stories, people together and food, there's this beautiful fermentation of community care and it can be people at their best, \n\n~So stories are really powerful.~\n\n~Stories are a reminder of past, they're a reminder of emotion and feeling and experience.~\n\n",

It's practical, more so than anything. It's awesome. Also it speaks to what people that are living on the streets need in a wider sense is access to facilities . There's two types of facilities that would benefit from having community access to the first is necessary.\n\nUtilities like kitchen, shower, laundry. 'cause there aren't spaces where you can just go to do those necessary living function things for free. And the second, third space that would be amazing to see more so in the community is free spaces just to be and to build community from, for example a clothing exchange, like free clothing exchange, [00:01:00] a place with couches, with a kitchen, with a lounge, just to hang out during the daytime.\n\nA place where there's a free bookshelf, a place that encourages free trade. 'cause if you can facilitate an environment where people can help people, that's the best way to solve things. Most people are generous especially people that are in difficult situations.\n\n",

One is 10 and one is seven. And they know that I come on shift on Monday nights. I have to get out of the house on time. I wear my. Uniform. And when I get home they wanna know how did it go? Did you meet anyone new? Did you do a lot of laundry? Those kinds of things.

What's what's the last few years been like? The last four years have been a bit crazy.\\~~[00:00:00] \n\nIt's just been quite difficult accessing services. I've just had to work out different ways of getting things done that I had to, thankfully, because where I used to work.\n\nI knew we used to get a lot of people up and moving, so I know you've just got to keep moving and grooving and yeah, that was really fortunate. I come here on I've only really been coming here the last couple of months because I didn't know about it beforehand.\n\nI found it very helpful. They do a meal, it's like a little camaraderie with a few of the guys that seem to be fairly regular and nice. We've got different ladies that volunteer here, but they also seem to be in a roster. I've seen a few of them a couple of times, and it's just nice to know the washing is washed and dried and I've set for the week.\n\nSuch a simple thing, which for me, I can wash that. I cannot go up and downstairs or hang on my clothes line. So it's been like a massive life save. It's been very helpful. \\~~What's the connection like for you here? Like how.\\~~\n\n\\~~I am like, like I said, I've only been a few months, but everybody seems to be unusually nice.\\~~\n\n",

What our friends really value is being seen, heard, and respected as individuals with stories that matter.\nEvery week, our volunteers across Australia and New Zealand don't just wash clothes – they create spaces where genuine conversation and friendship can flourish.

So my only exposure is walking in and walking out seeing that seeing the laundry and what I know from people who should sit with me on the table.~[00:00:00] \n\nThey're very thankful that somebody can take care of their laundry and not only take care of the laundry, but take care of them. Somebody who's gonna talk to them, somebody who's not gonna make them feel like they're, they're their duty, but hey we're here. We're doing laundry, we're talking, we're making friends.\n\nFellowship is a strong word that we like to use. So having fellowship and not just a duty. I think also I struggled that a lot for a long time, is. Serving as I am here and you are there and I'm putting my hand down to help you. It doesn't feel so good. It is not, it doesn't build the other person.\n\nAnd what I get from, the gentleman and the woman that I meet here is, that's not the attitude. The attitude is we're sitting together. There's no one is putting their hand down. We're sitting together. And that's very powerful. \n\nSpeaker: ~What's this idea of story for you? The reason I'm doing this is that we're gonna have lots of different people's telling their story. Yeah.~\n\n",
