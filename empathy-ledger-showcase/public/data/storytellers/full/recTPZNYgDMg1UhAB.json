Yep. Just your name and spell it for me first. My name is Aaron. Spell A-A-R-O-N. Sure. Last name. Stapleton. 42 years old. Been staying here at Vinny's for the last four weeks or so now. Yeah, been using yeah, laundry service, which is bloody awesome. It's great. They do an excellent job.<�/p> <�p>Big help, especially when we're in a position like we are. And just little things like washing and stuff like that, it is hard to, hard to find a place to do it and stuff like that. So the convenience is awesome. Okay. Any questions or anything like that? And what about, a bit about yourself though?<�/p> <�p>That's, tell us a bit about our story. My story this time last year, I was basically running a company as a managing supervisor. A few bad things happened. A few people passed away, things went bad. Break up with a partner. Ended up getting myself locked up, come outta jail with nowhere to go. Basically lived on the streets around here for about two months or so until I was fortunate enough to get a place here.<�/p> <�p>And just getting back on my feet now, mate. <�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:01:00]<�/span> Yeah. Stubborn for myself again, and get back into all this. Yeah. How does that sort of, like people, I think general people struggle with this idea of homelessness, struggle, marginalization and stuff. Yeah. How would you explain your own experience?<�/p> <�p>I guess they aren't too sure about what's going on. For me it was first moral denial. I didn't wanna think I was a basically homeless, say bum on the street and stuff like that, yeah. It's hard experience, especially asking for help and stuff, especially like someone like me doesn't usually ask for help and stuff like that.<�/p> <�p>But when you're in the position that we have been, when you're going through this, you realize you need help. Any little thing can really help, I found I've met a lot of people in the same position too, which there's been some really nice people. There's also been some really bad people, some bad influences and stuff like that, and just.<�/p> <�p>Drinking and drugs that go on stuff around here, just keep clear of that. And I do my own thing. I love fishing in my spare time, stuff like that. So <�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:02:00]<�/span> yeah, I'd rather go out fishing than hang around some of the bad people, but yeah, homelessness, you never think it's gonna happen to you 'cause it could any day.<�/p> <�p>Like I said, I was a manager of company only $60,000 a year last year. And I lost it all like that. Yeah. Say how would you say eyeopening experience makes you a bit more humble? Appreciate and a lot more things, and also want those things too back, so now it's basically up to me. I've yeah, done a fair bit of work at, people who have been incarcerated and especially young people and stuff.<�/p> <�p>Yeah. How would you explain that experience from going into coming out? How would I explain it? It's not my first time I've been in jail. I'm like one of the older groups in jail now. It's horrible place, but everyone ends up there for a reason, it's a horrible place.<�/p> <�p>That's what I wanna say, mate. But usually, yeah, people that are in there for a reason and yeah. Avoid it at all costs. Yeah. The petty bullshit that people do to get themselves in there isn't really worth at the end of the day. You <�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:03:00]<�/span> can earn a lot more in one day's work that you can from stealing or robbing or whatever, whatever you've done wrong to get in there.<�/p> <�p>And what about that transition out period? Transition out period? So this is what I found hard. While I knew I was getting out, I had a sentence date. I knew what was coming up and that, and I had about two months to go left on the sentence, and I was trying to ring around and find a place to go because I'd been staying with my mother before this.<�/p> <�p>But she's a bad drug user. I was doing really well and she sold everything I had. I had nothing to go back to. So I was trying to find places, for example, caravan, parks everywhere. We don't have too many resources in jail, so a lot of it was through social workers or just getting my mates to inquire about caravan parks and stuff like that.<�/p> <�p>And that's just as much as the house these days at caravan park per week. Even just a tent bloody thing in the Cameron Park. Too much. And so basically I got let out with no place to go stay and. That wasn't <�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:04:00]<�/span> a good start, like struggled there for ages. Don't get along with a lot of my family.<�/p> <�p>They've got their own things going on too. I don't like treating on people as well, so yeah, not having anything to come out to like that was my biggest worry, yeah. Then I just had to make do mate. How do you think or did you ever experience as a young person or how do you think that affects young people who go through that detention system?<�/p> <�p>I don't think young people should. My brother as a juvenile did a lot of juvenile jail, spent a, all his juvenile, he's still in jail to this day. He is 35 and probably done 30. Not. Literally probably 25 years jail and now serving a couple of bad sentences",
