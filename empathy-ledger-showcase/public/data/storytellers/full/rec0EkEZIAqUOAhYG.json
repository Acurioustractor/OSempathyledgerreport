  "transcript": "from Mackay but you know North Queensland they're talking about down south it's South of Rockhampton yeah and I'm talking about Sydney yeah yeah yeah my old man the day he finished his apprenticeship he got on his 125cc motorbike in 1955 and rode out of Mackay never to return oh really yeah Mackay to Rocky was all dirt still at that stage yeah there was no bitumen North of Rockhampton I was in Mackay last few weeks ago I don't mind it all right got a lot bigger yeah all right that'll do right it's your name and spell it that's cool too yeah when you look at me it's all cool okay yeah I'm Greg Graham g-r-e-g-g-r-a-h-a-m cool and tell us a little bit about yourself I guess what's a couple of couple of key key points that what people know about you yeah I've been retired now for three years and working with Orange Sky for about two and a half for those three years um predominantly here but I cover the odd shift shortage if we've got a sort of a group chat that if people are short and they jump on and we go and help out so I live locally not far from here and um yeah it's been a good thing for me in retirement it's been a good opportunity to get out and about and do something different to what I did for 40 odd years at work what'd you do for work I worked in the heavy earth moving and mining equipment sector so worked for the caterpillar dealer here in Newcastle for the last eight years before I finished up 21. I don't know if I have a breezy caterpillar deal or not I've got a couple of thousand there's probably a few of them in there yeah I might know him Marshall's his name I can't remember his name um Cole what's um what's what's come to Orange Sky like for you how does it feel that feels pretty good yeah we've got a regular group of people that we help with their laundry here and together with the the lunch etc that Catholic Care put on so it's yeah it's kind of a knit little group and then we have a few people who you know probably aren't that regular but the regular people are all super friendly and I'm happy to be part of the whole Orange Sky experience and like it's um laundry and stuff yeah so we wash and dry people's clothing for them that they either don't have access to it or there's something else that prevents them from from doing their own laundry whether it's their health or um the fact they don't have access to the facilities etc it can be any number of things so we don't pry too deeply into why they they use it we're just happy to give them a hand and take it from there what's the feeling of like the connection I guess and conversation and stuff is it pretty casual yeah generally it's pretty casual you know some people a bit more upset one week to the next but um yeah generally pretty casual and I think the fact that we've got so many regulars and that we've got a pretty small team here there's only six or seven people in the group and there's only six or seven of us work this shift and so a lot of us are here most weeks and we've got to know all these people you know really well what's um has it changed you in any way do you think in terms of perception or life or anything after volunteering oh look I think I won't say I lived my whole life under a rock but I think you don't when you're immersed in full-time work and you're not doing any volunteering of any kind it's pretty easy to just live in your own little bubble it's pretty easy to just live in your own little bubble and not have a very broad understanding of you know what life's like for other people that aren't that far from where you live and what what's your perception of this area I guess in Newcastle and is there is there different areas in Newcastle that are doing a bit more tough than others um yeah look I think this area generally does it tough it just whether the economy is good or not these people are you know they're up against it and um you know you just pick it up in the conversations with them and you know you just pick it up in the conversations with them and it's it's um you know it's a life's life's uh a bit challenging for a lot of these people a lot of the time there's no there's no easy days here and um so yeah that's been one of the good things it just helps you be a bit more grounded and I think the other thing is you realize that you know it's pretty easy when you're you know embroiled in your own little bubble to be more judgmental than you should be and yeah a bit more considerate of the nature of what people are up against um I really started just because I I wanted to do something that would help other people with their you know the time I had on my hands once I retired and um I'd seen a bit of media about Orange Sky and I thought it was a good idea and I just put my hand up to to volunteer for it so what's the conversation with friends and family changed in terms of what you do here and do they ask about this and homelessness yeah they do I think um yeah they most people here in Newcastle don't really understand what goes on Hamilton South or public housing areas and um so it's been good to be able to say look you know they're just people making their way as best they can and um you know it's not not whatever your preconceived notion of what goes on um you know it's typically um not not accurate what's um it's like a different question I I never am good at answering this but what's the type of things you think look like the person can do that's kind of helpful for people that are experiencing homelessness like outside of giving money or whatever are there actions that they can take is there a perception that they can change like what's your take on what people can do well I think if they you know if their rest of their life sort of allows it get involved in some face-to-face stuff because you know you can read about lots of things but you really need to get that personal experience and interaction with people to get a deeper and better understanding of of what's going on that's a good answer it's a little better answers I've got for that uh cool is there anything else like you wanted to say in relation to orange sky like um my very good mate Nicholas Marchese is listening so feedback critical yeah no we're I think we're very well supported by the broader Orange Sky organization and the people you know when we've had technical issues or anything like that um it's never been too much trouble for anyone we've had to get on the other end of the phone so you know it's the it's a robust Front Line Organization and it's got a robust back room that's helping those people that are delivering the services to their to our friends gotta wave out a brand team too yeah last four years yeah no it's a strong brand it's a lot of people you don't have to explain too much you know about what Orange Guy does once you tell them they go oh yeah that's the the laundry bands or you know okay that's that's it that's all it's an out, not an option one by one one by one by one is a good thing. whatever so I think yeah whoever's running the brand piece is doing a good job. Cool, maybe I can say that back to Nicholas and I can go get a bonus for my previous time building the brand. Yeah, cool that's it. Hit him up. Pay the money Nicholas.",
