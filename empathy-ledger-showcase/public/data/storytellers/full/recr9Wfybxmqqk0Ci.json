I used to work at the, at Walls End Centrelink. Prior to that I was a manager of an army disposal store. But I was at Centrelink for about two years. I took a redundancy and prior to that I was about eight, six to seven years at Commonwealth Service. So you're a full time job? Yeah, I'm a full time job. I'm a full time job. Cool. What's, what's your current like living situation now? What are you, what are you doing? I live in a one bedroom unit just around behind this community centre here and I haven't got a washing machine because I can't fit one in. It's limited, it's very limited for space. But it's better than living on the street. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just, yeah, a little bit of a little bit of a stretch. You know, so it's good that way. Yeah. Tell us about how you first found out about Ironsky. Well the lady that lived above me, she was some, won some award and she told me about this and I didn't know about it and I came round here because I was paying the lady next door five bucks every week to wash. But I, that was it, just washing. It wasn't put, drying. This is great. This is great because it washes. And this is it. and they drive for you which is fantastic yeah and it's easy for me to get around here too yeah that's cool and what's the like how does it feel to be able to come and have people to talk with and engage oh it's really good yeah they're really great people that work for you yeah unbelievable yeah what's a normal shift feel and look like like what do you do during the shift what's a normal shift like what do you do during a normal shift what do you what do you get up to like what happens well when this is here you may know just sit down and generally talk and just wait for wait for the washing to be done yeah nothing else no i can't run around the block anymore like i used to when you're 82 years old you're limited in what you can do you know what's it like to having volunteers here that listen to you and talk to you and stuff oh they're great they're great great people fantastic what do you talk about what do you get up to oh just what they do and what like we got one one bloke greg is most amazing man i've ever known in my life at 61 year old yeah the things he's doing i just just can't he's just unbelievable he's so fit he's unbelievable greg unbelievable and they're so the ladies are so nice and friendly and they're really great yeah that's cool what's um and you've got other people here that you talk with other people that aren't volunteers which what's that mate do you have other people that aren't volunteers that you talk with here that oh yeah well sometimes some people come by and they have a bit of a yap yeah i know it's good because it's we don't really associate with a lot of people around here because there's around where the other side of the road there's a lot of drug guys and i'm not interested in drugs oh look at you what you've done here in year territory it's been tough for the first couple days just being around here for a bit all right gregson sounds great i mean you know where're you as hey well i've been around here for about because of working in Adobe the software disappeared a little bit this and Cool. And what's, have you got a message for the Orange Sky people that run this show? Like there's two founders that run Orange Sky, like Nick and Luke as they started it, and then there's a whole big team. What would you say to them if you had a chance to talk to them? Oh, I think it's a fantastic job that they've done. I think unbelievable. I mean, one of the greatest job things that someone could do, because a lot of people haven't got washing machines and they've got no facilities, or they've got to hand wash. You know, if I didn't have the woman next door, or didn't have you, I'd have to do everything by hand, which is a bit of a pain. You know, no, no, it's fantastic service, mate. And it's free. That's the big thing. Yeah. Makes it helpful, yeah. Yeah. So good. Is there anything else you wanted to say to anyone or anything about Orange Sky or about... No, no, nothing more. Yeah. Quite happy with what they do and congratulate the mob that did it, that set it up. So good. Well done. You did do really good.",
