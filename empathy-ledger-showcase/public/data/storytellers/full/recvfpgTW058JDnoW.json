Three, two. Oh, we should say the same about the van. Oh yeah. Oh really? Let's, who runs outta battery first? Yeah. Alright, cool. Ready to go. Um, name and spell. It'll be awesome. My name's Beck Smy, B-E-C-S-M-Y-T-H. Cool. Uh, Kita Zim. K-E-E-D-A-Z-I-L-M. Keda, why don't you go first and tell me a tiny bit about yourself first?<�/p> <�p>About myself? Yeah. Uh, about myself. Um, I, I'm a wine maker based in the Bara. I live here in Adelaide. Um, I grew up down in Kingston, in the southeast. And I dunno what to tell you about myself. That's really interesting. Actually. I, um, <�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:01:00]<�/span> yeah. I don't know what to tell you. Great. Yeah. Good start. Yeah. Um, back and, um, I was born in England, grew up in Adelaide, but then I've lived in Darwin and Canberra and Sydney and Hong Kong and Darwin again and back to Adelaide and.<�/p> <�p>I used to be a teacher, but I've retired. It's fantastic. That's my, I know. It's so good. How did you first hear about, uh, through an organization that I did some other volunteer work for, and to be honest, I didn't know that this site existed. I drive down Port Road regularly and didn't even know what, what was here, and went on the website and applied and found this.<�/p> <�p>Many, many opportunities to, to volunteer. So, um, and I just thought it was such a wonderful pause. <�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:02:00]<�/span> Um, has it changed over time, I suppose, your thoughts about Orange Skype? Thoughts about your thoughts about why you're doing this or similar? Yeah, it's had a huge, a huge impact on my perspective of, number one, how grateful I truly am for, for my personal situation and I guess.<�/p> <�p>How to share basic dignities with people. Um, it doesn't take a lot. It's just time. It's just my time. There's nothing else I need to give up to, to do this. And you meet so many wonderful people, not only the, the volunteers. We've got such a great friendship base, um, but you know, the friends of Orange Sky that, that we get to spend time with.<�/p> <�p>So it's, it's really, it's really special actually. Yeah. So, um, I'd love for you to tell me like. What it's like or what this place is like in relation to the people who work as support and service providers and stuff. Like Walk, walk us through where we are and, and what, what this is <�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:03:00]<�/span> like. So do you mean these just, just this whole place and the whole, yeah.<�/p> <�p>Okay. It's not quite and peaceful 'cause it's right in the middle of Port Road in literally in the middle of the road. But it's, it's always a. It's always a pleasant place to be. Like you come and there's always a bunch of people hanging around, having some food, having a chat. There's always a cue for the laundry, which is really good.<�/p> <�p>'cause you, you know, you want, that's why we're here. We, we want to do people's laundry. Um, it's a really interesting mix of people. So you get some regulars that you see day in and day out, and then you get. People that, you know, some people who come for a while and then they vanish. Um, it's interesting sometimes when you know, somebody hasn't been for a while who used to always come and everyone's like, oh, are they okay?<�/p> <�p><�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:04:00]<�/span> What's going on? And then you just get people that were just passing through. So you eat. So it's, it's always a pleasant place to be. Like, every time I walk home, I walk home with a smile on my face going, oh yeah, that was fun. Yeah, that's cool. And the people working in the, in the food hub are amazing.<�/p> <�p>Absolutely amazing. Those two in particular, the, the, they're just phenomenal. Yeah. It's a little family unit and, um, I have a sit. What's it like sort of relating to people like Julie and, um, is there a way you approach that in terms of when they first turn up? Or like, how does that feel, I guess, to be able to engage with someone?<�/p> <�p>Uh, I think you, you realize that it's more, more than just having your washing done week to week, which is such a simple thing for you and I to do. In fact, it's a chore <�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:05:00]<�/span> that you just loathe and you forget to do it, you know, whatever it may be, but. That they, you know, people come for the company and the genuine connection and that feels that, that's just a lovely, another lovely aspect of of this, I think.<�/p> <�p>And like when Julie first came, she was very quiet and very timid. And now she's completely comfortable and she's joking with people and. You know, it's a, it's a regular thing. Yeah. It's nice just getting people to slowly open up an",
