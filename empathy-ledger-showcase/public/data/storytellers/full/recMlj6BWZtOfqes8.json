Mum's up in Queensland. I clap. I told her not to get there. Alright, I've got some riggle room to play with here. Oh, cold there. Oh, she's gone. It'll be shitty. And the sun comes out right as I don't want it to. Yeah, just saw it. All right, brother, just tell me your full name and spell it for me.<�/p> <�p>So my name is Edward. Edward Campion. C-A-N-P-I-U-N. Yeah. Awesome. Tell me a little bit about yourself first. I've been, up until last week, I've been homeless for first of about a month. Before that I was in temporary accommodation where there was limited, limited services. In regards to cooking, washing, that kind of thing.<�/p> <�p>Basically go to bed, wake up, go spend the day walking around. Yeah. Before that. Yeah. <�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:01:00]<�/span> What did you need? I was, in a couple of share houses that never worked out. So it led me to temporary accommodations. That temporary accommodation ran out. Like I said, back to homelessness. And then last week I ended up receiving good news from Department of Housing, getting it my own place.<�/p> <�p>Wow. But I still haven't got the washing machine, so I've just, I've spent the last two nights, the last two nights just sleeping on the floor and a sleeping bag. It's good. It's my own place now. I just need to start gathering all the bits and pieces. Cool. How'd you first hear about Orange Sky?<�/p> <�p>Through St. Benedict's Community Center, actually. I've been coming here for a fair bit probably over a year and a half. I've used the service quite a few times. It's fantastic. Yeah, it'll be lost there. Lost without it, with those Saint Benedict as well. Good support network in. You've got St.<�/p> <�p>Benedict, you've got Salvation Army, you got St. Pins of the <�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:02:00]<�/span> poor, and of course you got Orange Sky. A homeless girl. Yeah. Without services. You'd be walking around stinky. A bit of it's like service, but then a bit of it's like connection and conversation. What do you think about that in terms of the difference between just getting something done and having some community?<�/p> <�p>It's good. No, that, that's a good point. You can have a chat with the crew here, the volunteers, your cup of tea and the chat and. It's good for your mental wellbeing. You have a yarn, have a laugh. You are here at, different ideas and different, some other services that may be able to help.<�/p> <�p>Yeah, it's a good connection, good network. What. Do you think of this idea of collaboration between Orange Sk",
