  "transcript": "make this like have to think about all right just tell me your name and um spell it for me be awesome too good morning my name i'll talk to you okay great my name is jackie j-a-c-q-u-i cool jackie how long you been volunteering and tell me a little bit about like orange sky yeah i started volunteering with orange sky i think about 2018 originally it was at a different site and then of course we had 12 month break with covid but i love it i yeah i i love what how it helps our friends but we have a fabulous team here it's a really constant team you know there's no egos everyone's here for a common goal to provide support to those friends in need yeah i love it tell me tell me things you like about orange sky in terms of like the stuff yeah i love the fact that we're providing a laundry service which certainly helps with dignity most of our friends are male we for this shift for some reason we very rarely have females and a few of the fellas live in their cars um no one's sleeping rough that i'm aware of but it's just great to have some have some fresh clothes and to have that connection when they come back fortnight after fortnight and you can just the conversation can continue on you know like like you would with a friend um and i think that that connection's you know great for us feeling like we're doing something meaningful but it's also a great way to kind of get to know each other and i think that's what's so great for them so tell me a bit about like your journey into orange sky what was that like like how did you hear about it and how did you start to i heard about orange sky when the lads won the young australian of the year and when i heard that i thought oh if that comes to newcastle i'm going to volunteer for them my background's working in public health and i guess i was familiar with people of all different social backgrounds but also i had a family member who did it tough and was lost contact with us and i think that's what i'm going to do for the rest of my life and i think that's what i'm going to do for the rest of my life so it's about giving back as well i think a woman that's cool what's the um what's it feeling like sitting down and talking to one of our friends i guess like is it different to your everyday conversations how does it like how it's similar yeah it can it can be different in that i'm aware that they're not in the same financial situation so you might not have the same sorts of things to talk about like you know what perhaps what i've been doing but you can just ask them about how their week's been and what they've been doing you know some of the fellows who've got a house follow sport so we get to know that we get to know if they've got a hobby like fishing and so you try and find some common ground that you can just just have a chat about that's so cool you sort of partner with the church here they um food and stuff how's the relationship with them and how does that kind of work that relationship's fantastic they do a great job here and they've really embraced us so if there's things going on throughout the year they will try and include us maybe as a helper but also as a social arrangement we help them with pancakes on show of tuesday they invite us to their christmas function but they're very they're very inclusive i think it's a really great partnership how important are these types of things um in supporting people are doing tough in australia like how important is being able to partner with food services conversations i think i think it's really important because our friends have a lot of experience with the church and they're really so many challenges and if they can get their washing done for nothing financially will help them but they can also access food at the same time it's one less thing for them to have to be thinking about and and worrying about i think i think it's really important that that partnership continues do you know what the general feel is in newcastle around like people struggling and people doing a tough like is it is it something that people think about often or is it hidden what do i think largely is still pretty hidden and i'm surprised still even though i've had this connection with orange sky for six years and my friends certainly know when i talk about the laundry what i'm doing but i still encounter people who have no idea so i don't know whether we need more promotion or maybe maybe they just don't know because they're not in the volunteering community i don't know but i guess how you how you put it out to the people who need the service rather than the general public knowing i personally where i live don't see people sleeping sleeping rough but i do see fellas walking around who look homeless they've just got a bag of things and and i think it's probably more prevalent than we realize cool that's about it fantastic well i'm just going to tell",
