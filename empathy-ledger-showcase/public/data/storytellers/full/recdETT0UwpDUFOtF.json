  "transcript": "# Amanda Brasnja\n\n[00:00:00]Â \n\nLet you go with your drink. I'm just gonna clap my hands. Oh, sorry. Okay. We're ready to rock and roll. Okay. So these things don't worry about, just look at me. Yep. I don't know what you want from me. No, I'll just I'm here to walk you along this process, so don't feel like you need to do any of the work.\n\nOkay. You are here just to have a yarn and have. Fun. And you sure? You're good with me squinting at you? Is that okay? Is it real? Yeah. No, I know. I'm just gonna be squinty. No, that's fine. It looks great. All you need to do is you do full name and spell it for me. Amanda Broner. You don't want me to spell Amanda, do you?\n\nNo, it's, I think she should be fine. Brasner? Yeah. B-R-A-S-N-J-A. Where's, do you know where that last name's from? Serbia. Serbia? Yeah. Former Yugoslavia. Amazing. Yes. Cool. How do you introduce yourself, identify yourself? Like how would you introduce yourself to someone? I just, Amanda? Yeah. I don't have anything fancy.\n\nI'm just me. Cool. Yep. And what's a little bit about [00:01:00] Amanda then? Why I do it? Or just yourself? Talk about yourself, where you're from, what you do. Tassy girl. Yeah. I lived overseas for a few years, lived up north of the state, but stay in Hobart because Why wouldn't you? It's fabulous. And, yeah.\n\nWhy Hobart? What's fabulous about it? I grew up on the Eastern shore. And as I've gotten older, I've realized like to live next to two beaches is a lifestyle that people in Sydney pay gazillions for, and I don't have to. And so to just. To, it's just a beautiful place. We've got everything we need, we've got the mountain there, we've got the river there, one of the seventh natural deepest harbors in the world.\n\nJust in case you need to know that. And I've lived overseas and as much as all these other places are lovely. How about wind? Say again with me. How'd you first hear about Orange Sky? I heard it on the telly and I didn't [00:02:00] really know, like I heard about the two teenage boys don't do their own washings suddenly washing for other people.\n\nAnd I'm like, oh, that's funny. But I used to work. With a girl who had the jumper on one day and I quizzed her 'cause I can't help my mouth. And she was telling me how she actually volunteered, like Thursday nights she'd go from work and volunteered just out in the city. And I always wanted to do it because it just seems like a nice thing to do.\n\nAnd then four years ago I got more time in my life. Mum passed away, so I was like, got time to fill in, got stuff to give aggressively helpful some of my friends say. So I got to be aggressively helpful here. What what keeps you coming back to Orange Sky staying here? Like the guys that I work with we do Sunday mornings.\n\nIt's, they're nice people. Like some of them are just so sweet and generous and nice and these guys like, [00:03:00] they've got, it doesn't matter what's happening in my world, this is always gonna be harder than anything I have to do. So why not give 'em three hours? It's no skin off my nose. What do you think the impact of Orange Sky is across the different domains?\n\nSo there's washing, there's connection, there's conversation, there's partnership. What's in your mind? What's stands out for you? I look it's the connections that, like some of these guys and, we'll only speak to them for 20 minutes and potentially not see them again. But some of them are just so sweet and they just wanna chat and I'm bang up for a chat.\n\nSo why wouldn't, like, why not have a chat and. And when I see them in town, I work in the city during the week, and you see people ignore them and. That just feels mean and I mean it's life, so whatever, it's just nice to give a bit of my time to [00:04:00] them. And the washing's good.\n\n'cause no one ever wants to do their own washing. Okay. What sort of conversations do you have with either friends, family, public, around our. Always an easy or difficult conversation or what any conversation with me is easy. So I just tell people and it just, some people say, oh, maybe it's time to give it up.\n\nHaven't you done enough? And it's it's three hours a week. And I've say to people, anyone can do it. It's not a big deal in your life. It's, it's such an easy thing to do, but people just don't. I don't think people register.\n\nI think people don't register that they can help. Beyond just their immediate family. And as well as some people, I only want to help if they can put it up on social media. I don't do any of that. I don't care. But yeah, I've, I did get, I've only once has someone actually stopped me and said, oh, do you [00:05:00] do that?\n\nAnd I was like, yeah. Yeah. And I had a chat with this bloke and he was down in Hobart. He was up from down from Queensland, and he is yeah, I used to do it. He said, now I donate to them. I don't do it anymore, but I donate. And I'm like, that's lovely. That's cool. Yeah. And when I arrived you were deep in conversation with Felicity and Yeah.\n\nLike having a gun. Yeah. What stood out from Felicity's story? Anything for you or is, was that like a unique conversation, a normal conversation or unique in that Felicity's obviously gone through? Everyone's gone through a lot. Yeah. But Felicity's gone through such a specific thing and like Felicity being tall and a friend of mine, her middle child is a six three transgender.\n\nFemale. Transition. I don't know all the right words. Apologies. Transition at 18, but always knew before that. But such a quiet, [00:06:00] meek person. Meek's not the right word. Just a quiet personality and hearing Felicity talk like some awful stuff, but such a strong person. And it's that's nice to hear.\n\nAnd I also wanna hug everyone. And I think what stood out for me was the surprise of the services available, but also the genuine love of what it's, is that something that is normal for friends to be so connected to it or everyone has their different story, massive mixed bag like.\n\nOne of everything kind of thing. We had a guy that used to come here who was, I called him the geologist I can't remember what it was, but he'd done everything like he was super smart, so many smart, like really intelligent, highly intelligent people here who use words that I sit there and go. In all my years of schooling, I like, [00:07:00] I know I've heard it, but I don't understand it.\n\nLike so many smart people. That's actually probably very eye opening to me because when I grew up, it's like you go to school, you go to college, you go to uni, you do all these things because then you can achieve in life. And these kids are saying, yeah, I went to, really expensive schools.\n\nAnd then you're talking to them going, mate, what happened? How did the, you know, it just, so I try to not, I know afterwards I do, but I try not to think about that at the time because I just, yeah, just, I don't know. I'm just waffling now. Great. That was good. Waffling. Yeah. Was there anything we didn't touch on that you feel is important or things that have stood out with Orange Sky that we didn't talk about?\n\nNo. What's the, any other vibes of volunteers, any like tips for Nick and Lucas around how to be better leaders or oh God, I always have an opinion. That's [00:08:00] terrible. I just, I wish more people, I don't know how you get more people to know about it and care about it. 'cause there's so many things that everybody cares about at the minute and there's.\n\nThere's so many new diseases being raised money for, and ice bucket challenge and whatever. Like how do you get to be the one that everyone cares about? And like in Hobart, they're talking about this stadium and then someone goes, but what about all the people that need houses?\n\nAnd it's it's a hard one. It's a big one. I don't, I'm, yeah. Selfishly I'm doing a lot of work in youth justice and yeah. Detention center here is a cluster of everything. So I yeah. I genuinely find some of these things just too hard to even think about because it just, it hurts my brain and my heart too much.\n\nYeah. Yeah. You're not doing as bad as Queensland and mentee there. Yeah. That's nice to know. It's terrible, but it's nice to know. But yeah, I just, that's amazing. Just stay there for a quick [00:09:00] photo.\n\nI'm just gonna clap my hands because it helps me sync the cameras up. Alright, I think we're rocking. Just look at me. Yep. First of all, just your full name and spell it. Spell it? Yeah. Just say your full name and spell it. My name's Sarah Jessica Meyers. S-A-R-A-H-I-R-E-L-N. A and d No, I'm terrible at spelling.\n\nNo, that's okay. I wasn't expecting that. Sorry. Oh, that was a head fuck. I've gotta but my full name is Sarah Jessica Meyer. So just tell me a little bit about yourself at the beginning. I originally grew up in wa. I moved to Tasmania in 2006 with my parents through, I guess a relationship breakdown with my parents.\n\nI ended up in the welfare [00:10:00] system. I, by the time I think I was 14, I was a offending and hanging out with some not good so good people, which resulted with me getting incarcerated quite a number of times. By the time I was 16, I'd broken out of that cycle of bad behavior and I guess addiction.\n\nI suffered with addiction issues when I was younger and it's led into homelessness as an adult. So it's my story. When I was 19, I got into my first relationship and. We had a good relationship for a number of years before it turned sour. But through that period I actually went and did my youth work, cert four and ended up working for council for a little while.\n\nSo there's many bad things that I have experienced. I've always tried to do the right thing and educate myself in ways that I can better look after myself and the community. And yeah, that's what. Just tell [00:11:00] me at any point, or you don't wanna answer something, but what are some of those lessons you think that stand out the most from believe in yourself?\n\nI think that's the biggest thing that I've taken out of this, is that everyone has different problems. We all come from different walks of life, and sometimes you've just gotta be there for yourself instead of looking for outside validation. You should recognize that you are the most important person in your life and that only you can help you, I think a lot of people seek outside validation to help themselves when really it's about going inwards, not outwards.\n\nAnd I think that's probably the best thing that I've learned is to work on yourself. And it honestly never stops. You'll always be learning. But it's that courage to try and it's that courage to wanna do better. I think the one thing that stands out straight away from the first part of your story is, bravery and you being able to [00:12:00] tell that story, I think that's important.\n\nBut then there's also experience in which you pass on. What are some of the ways in which you are working to pass on your experience to support other people that might like you guys? I think just being there for people. I think experience wise I know what it was like as a young person, not to have someone there, and so I think just showing up and being present, being there for people when they need it, everyone has different problems my ability to help my only just be advice and sending 'em in the right direction with someone who has that.\n\nInformation so that they can make an informed decision about what they're doing and not make a decision based from fear and being alone. Because I think a lot of the time that is what happens. People internalize their struggles and they make emotional decisions rather than rational ones.\n\nI think a lot of the curriculum, I think if we taught emotional intelligence and things like that in the schools, it would help a lot, for people to be able to navigate their own. [00:13:00] Problems. Yeah. I think most of the population has a very surface level of these words. Homelessness or struggle or disadvantage.\n\nWhat is it, what does that mean to you? Are those types of are they stigma? Are they worth connect with? How's that? Me and my friends argue about this all the time because I think homelessness is a choice. You can choose to wanna be a better person or you can choose to buy into the addictions and these things that were fed by society.\n\nBut it is a choice. And like I said emotional intelligence and having the ability to make an informed decision got will take you a lot further. And so I think education at the very basic. Level is a fundamental thing that needs to change in our country because without education you can't make an informed decision.\n\nSo I think that is really where we need to start the reform process really of education and the curriculum and what we're [00:14:00] teaching children and young people, because otherwise we'll stay, we stay stuck. What is special or interesting about the stuff that Orange Sky is doing as a service? I think what Orange Sky is doing is amazing.\n\nI don't know if you guys have been to a laundry mat, but it costs about 15 to $20 to do one load of washing. And I think this service is good, it's economical. They're helping people that are in need. Yeah they're always here. They're such a nice bunch of people. The volunteers are awesome to chat to.\n\nI'm friends with a few of the girls, so I think I've come away with lifelong bonds, and that's important. Cool. What what do you like different people have different perceptions of what the impact starts. Like from laundry to connection, to conversation to that sort of stuff. What was it?\n\nWhat is it for you? A bit of everything, but I think the social thing is a big thing for me. I think when you are struggling, whether you are homeless or. Whether you're just introverted or whatnot, being [00:15:00] able to have other people to talk to and to connect with is very important. Everything is energy and it's nice to have people with such good, uplifting spirits to talk to.\n\nYou get into some pretty interesting conversations with these guys, so it is good. It's nice to have like positive outlook and people that wanna see you do well and wanna help. And like I said. I think 80% of any job is just showing up. It's just being present and not worrying about the past, not worrying about the future.\n\nThey're interested in the here and now, and I think that's very important 'cause so people, so many people get lost in the past or worry about the future and it's just nice to have people that wanna talk to you in the moment, want to see what's going on in your life and, yeah. Do you think it matters that everyone's a volunteer rather than paid like, differentiation between the service and what support?\n\nYes, because the people want to be there. There's a difference in, I think being paid to go and do a job and having people that are volunteering their own time and [00:16:00] energy and support to come and help people, it is because they want to be here. They want to help the community.\n\nAnd that ma it does make a big difference because. They don't have to be here. They're doing it off their own backs, and I think that's very important. Yeah. Is, are there certain things around being a female that's different in terms of disadvantage or struggle or homelessness in your life?\n\nI think it's easy to be a homeless woman than what it would be to be a homeless man. And I say that because I think men are always taught to protect women and to try and help and serve and that sort of stuff. So I think just in general, women are better looked after than men and it's just, it's sad, but it's true.\n\nSo I, I don't really think it, it's that I have a disadvantage or an advantage. It is what it is because it also comes with, I guess the safety aspect of being a woman. But that's pretty much the only thing that I would say gives me a. [00:17:00] Disadvantage, if you wanna call it that. But I I doing a fair bit of work in youth justice and Tasmania's in a fascinating position.\n\nNow the youth center is this weird transition where they dunno what to do. Do you have perceptions on what is the government role in how they support young kids when they are in that position? I was in welfare and I was also in that detention center eight times. Like most institutions, I actually think they're breeding grounds for people that are not doing the correct thing.\n\nUnfortunately, people, people hired very well. And the Ashley's youth detention center was a very sad thing because there were so many young people throughout that period that were taken advantage of. My question is, how come it went unnoticed for so long? And even though that they know with, multiple accounts and multiple people having [00:18:00] been arrested for not good things, I wonder why it has not been addressed and why it's still, why it still is open. Because they know for a fact there's been multiple incidences there where, children were molested and raped and all sorts of things, I don't really see that the government has done anything other than chuck money at people.\n\nAnd to me that's just kinda like hush money. So it, it's effectively just created a cycle of trauma for probably everybody involved. And I think the issue is the government per se, can't really do anything about those issues. We need people that. Have, like I said, the education level has to be, it has to mirror the issue.\n\nSo I think the first thing that they should do is probably get counselors, get the people that are experiencing trauma dealing with these traumas to work alongside those kids. At the moment, I think what's not being addressed is that, that they're not even getting the right service help.\n\nSo [00:19:00] I think that's the first thing to addressing the issue. I think you touched on before a bit, like again, there, it's how do you provide like agency for people to do it themselves and how do you create things that are around participation? Do you see any of that happening within the.\n\nSocial sector over, not really. And that's probably the problem is that the access points for businesses to be able to come together to help in social issues like this. There, there's no funding for it. A, as you said about the volunteer thing, it's gotta be people that wanna be there, but people that aren't gonna abuse their power in those positions.\n\nAnd I think that's vital for this cycle of trauma to stop. It's having the right people to come together, to work together, to close the gap, so to speak, to create a service that can then be funded by the government. But I think we in the community need to do that. Maybe the government can supply [00:20:00] the funding for things like that, but ultimately it, it's the community that has to look after the people, yeah. Alright. Sky started, there's two young fellas in and got pretty big. Yeah. How, do you have any recommendations on how you think they can continue to stay true to themselves as they continue to grow? Like they'll, there's obviously a lot more interest in them and money and stuff. Like how do they stay?\n\nClose to. I think staying with the volunteer program will probably make it very effective in the way that the people that will jump on board are all gonna wanna be there. I think in terms of expansion for Orange Sky most of the people that I do know that work for Orange Sky are in other job positions as well.\n\nAnd so I guess just utilizing the skills that they have from those other jobs, transferable skills. Yeah. But, yeah, ones that, are going to empower young people because I think there's a difference between supporting someone and empowering someone. And I think that's [00:21:00] what's gotta change.\n\nWe've gotta stop this. We support stuff in the start empowering people, that's, yeah. Are there it's always difficult to talk about like really specific things that changed. Like your course. Were there different things that changed your course along the way? You said you've been in detention a few times.\n\nLike there certain scenarios that changed your course, even the better or worse? I think the things that affected me were emotional. I. Response. I think I would deal with things as a young person and I didn't understand my emotions or how to handle them. And I think from a early age I dealt with a lot of trauma from a very early age.\n\nAnd so I didn't have, I guess the best peer support systems and I didn't have very good role models around me. I learned through that, or I learned through making lots of mistakes. That you shouldn't punish yourself. And education really does matter. [00:22:00] You think it doesn't when you are younger, but when you're 16 or 18 and you can't function as an adult it does reflect in both your behavior and the way you look.\n\nYeah it's still down to the, what we teach people is emotional intelligence. It's, making informed decisions, but you need education to do that. And unfortunately we have a lot of fake teachers now. I remember I dropped out of college basically 'cause I wanted to become an accountant, but the teacher that was teaching it had never worked a day in their life as an accountant.\n\nAnd I think for me, I started questioning these organizations and institutions where they were expecting us to come and give our time to get certificates, et cetera. But the people that were teaching us. These subjects weren't actually qualified to be teaching these subjects and had no life experience in those roles.\n\nAnd so I think for me it was the hypocrisy of it all. Was that you got all these people teaching you to go into this job, they'd never done the job. [00:23:00] How can he teach me to do something you've never done? So education really does matter and, yeah, and I guess what I said earlier about the having people that don't abuse their power, I think a lot of people are given power and a lot of people misuse it.\n\nSo that's probably what I would say. Last few words about like hanging around this sort of shift like experience, like what's it feel like for a someone that doesn't know what it's like to hang. So if you've never been to Salvos or you've never worked with Orange Sky for me the social interaction is very important.\n\nIt is giving me a safe space in the community to talk about. My life and the things I'm wanting to do. And I guess, like I said, having pe like different people to touch base with and that have the experience, they can give me advice and, they can support, but empower me to also do the right things, and I think that's very important. And I, without having, yeah, [00:24:00] without having that, support and empowerment. I think I would be just going in the same cycles and the same loops. So it's nice to have someone to break the chain, so to speak. 'cause it does matter. You, I think people don't realise How important friends are? I feel like recently I've had to cut off a lot of my old friends because I want better for myself or I want better for my life. And Orange Sky and the Salvation Army have been a big help in me being able to be on the straight and narrow. It's given me somewhere safe to come.\n\nIt's given me a whole new social circle. So it's been good and it's yeah it's helped me a lot. It gives me somewhere safe to go and somewhere, supportive and be, they do a lot for the community, not just me. So it is nice. Anything we didn't touch on that you want to talk about or other things that you Not off the top of my head.\n\nOkay. I think that's it. Yeah. Thank you [00:25:00] very much. Thank you. It was very nice. You did such a great job. I'm just gonna take a little photo.\n",
