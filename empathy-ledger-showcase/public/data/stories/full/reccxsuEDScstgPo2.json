  "transcript": "\\# 10-Year Wait for Public Housing: A Human Right Crisis\n\n[00:00:00] That story about it takes a village to grow children up.\n\nIt was certainly true in my case 'cause everyone in the camp, looked out for all the kids.\n\nSo much has changed. So much has changed. Not only in our cultural practices, but also, just in life in general and laws and legislation and whatever from the mainstream side as well as the most concerning thing, the loss of our language and culture.\n\nI think it's a 10 year waiting list on the waiting list for public housing here in Tennent Creek. It's a human, right for everybody to have, houses, but, Aboriginal people, I guess make do with what we can, live in tin houses, find ways around that.\n\n'cause we, you can cook on the fire, et cetera, et cetera.\n\nMedia have a lot to do with the narrative of everything that's happening around Australia, and sad to say, but Indigenous good news stories aren't picked up very well. It's all bad stuff that gets picked up.\n\n",
