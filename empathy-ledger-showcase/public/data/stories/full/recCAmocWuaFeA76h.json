  "transcript": "\\# The Heart of Tenant Creek: A Community Where Everyone Knows Everyone\n\n[00:00:00] Tennent Creek is a small town population of three and a half. It's in the Barkley region and I'm from Warumungu Tribe, which is situated in Tennent Creek, and my clan group is the White Cockatoo, and which is 30 Ks from Tennent Creek up north.\n\nI can just say white cockatoo is my dreaming clan group and it's situated at Philip Creek and it's a dreaming site we follow from start to finish. And there's another one that I'm connected through. The white cockatoo is the the Yukoorla. The Spinifex works.. And we make bush medicine out of Yukoorla and it's really good stuff. Tennent Creek is a small [00:01:00] community town which has different language groups here.\n\nSo everyone knows everyone. And if new people in town, we could just ask someone and say, oh, that's, that person is connected to that family group.\n\nWe have an Aboriginal organisation, which we are trying to set up Wilya Janta. We're trying to set up that one for housing and we're trying to start with our house. Culturally appropriate way. We're designing it to go with the, our culture fits in with our climate as well.\n\nIt's climate friendly, house.\n\nWe wanna help family throughout the NT and their First Nation People. They are too, same as us. We're hoping to set up a cultural tourism and cultural awareness [00:02:00] down the track.\n\nWe are hoping to do that with tourists to do cultural awareness within our language groups. And within our country, and to teach people who wants to know about our language and culture and our living environment and our languages, what's here.\n\n",
