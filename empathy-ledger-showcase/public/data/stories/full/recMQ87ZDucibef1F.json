As this friend shared, sometimes getting behind on laundry happens to anyone â€“ and having a helping hand (plus a friendly smile) can make all the difference.\nOur volunteers don't just wash clothes; they create moments of dignity and connection that ripple through communities.\n#SmallActsBigImpact #KindnessMatters #OrangeSkyVolunteers\n",
  "storyTranscript": "Community Kindness: A Helping Hand with a Smile\n===\n\nSpeaker 6: ~And what do you think about Orange Guy? ~\n\nSpeaker 5: ~Oh, ~[00:00:00] I appreciate it because there's been times when I've got behind with the washing and I've only got a small washing machine. And these gorgeous ladies and Jens, they'll take anything.\n\nAnd not only that, they'll dry it and they'll fold it for you all with a smile. \n\nSpeaker 6: Wow. And what about like the, just the people too? What do you think about the people and the service? \n\nSpeaker 5: The people are good. They're good, they're friendly.

Not my business.~\n\n",
